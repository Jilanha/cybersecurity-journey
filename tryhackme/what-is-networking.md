## 🧠 Summary:

This room introduced the fundamentals of computer networking from a security and troubleshooting perspective. Topics included:

- **What is a network** and how devices communicate
- **IP addresses** (IPv4) and their structure
- **DNS and DHCP** simplified
- The **OSI model**, focusing on how data travels across layers
- Basic introduction to **ports** and **protocols** (TCP, UDP)

---

## 🔍 My Key Takeaways:

- The OSI model provides a mental map to **understand attacks and defenses** at each level (e.g., spoofing at Layer 2, firewalls at Layer 4)
- DNS and DHCP are common entry points for attackers if misconfigured
- Even the basics like IP and MAC address formats are critical for triaging incidents

## 🛠️ What's Next:

- Apply this foundation to the upcoming “Connect and Protect” course (Course 3 in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate)
- Begin exploring TryHackMe rooms related to network traffic, packet capture, and secure communication
