- Real-world defensive tools like Suricata, Zeek, and Splunk

## 🔧 Tools Introduced:
- Splunk (log aggregation and alerting)
- Suricata (intrusion detection/prevention)
- Zeek (network monitoring tool)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Cybersecurity isn't just about stopping attacks — it’s about detecting patterns and minimizing damage
- Effective defenders are informed, not reactive
- Understanding logs and knowing what’s “normal” is the key to spotting threats

## 🔭 Next Steps:
- Dive deeper into SIEM with Splunk tutorials
- Begin Module 1 of Google Cybersecurity Certificate
