# TryHackMe - Intro to Offensive Security

🗓️ Date: July 16, 2025

## 🔑 Key Concepts I Learned:
- Difference between offensive and defensive security
- MITRE ATT&CK framework basics
- The phases of an attack: reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation
- Attacker mindset — thinking like a hacker

## 🛠️ Tools Mentioned:
- Nmap (port scanning basics)
- Burp Suite (intro only)
- Wireshark (packet sniffing)
- TryHackMe’s own browser-based VM

## 💡 Reflections:
This was my first exposure to the offensive side of cybersecurity. I learned how attackers approach systems and why it’s critical for defenders to understand their methods. It was hands-on, challenging, but incredibly valuable.

## 🧭 What’s Next:
- Networking Fundamentals (TryHackMe)
- Google Cybersecurity Course Module 1 (Foundations)
