# Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
## Course 3: Connect and Protect – Networks

🗓️ Date Completed: July 24, 2025  
🎯 Final Assessment Score: 100%

---

## 📚 Key Topics Covered:
- OSI Model vs TCP/IP stack
- IP addressing, ports, and protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Common network components: routers, switches, firewalls
- Network attacks: MITM, DDoS, DNS poisoning, sniffing
- Defensive tools: IDS/IPS, packet capture, firewalls, VPNs
- Basic packet analysis using `tcpdump`

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Networking is the **foundation of security visibility** — every packet tells a story
- The OSI model is a powerful tool for both designing defenses and identifying weaknesses
- Understanding protocols helps trace data flow and locate potential breach points
- Even small log samples can reveal suspicious patterns (like beaconing or misconfigurations)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Reinforced:
- tcpdump
- Basic port/protocol recognition
- ICMP/DNS analysis
- Behavior-focused log interpretation

---

## 🧭 What’s Next:
- Begin Course 4: “Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL”
- Apply networking knowledge in future labs (TryHackMe, Wireshark, Splunk)
- Start thinking like a packet-level threat hunter
