## 🧠 Overview

This module focused on understanding Linux, the command-line interface (CLI), and basic administrative operations. While I’ve tinkered with Linux before, this was the first time I explored how those skills apply directly to cybersecurity.

---

## 🔧 Key Concepts Covered:
- Navigating and managing files using Bash
- File permissions and how they relate to security
- The power and risk of `sudo` and root access
- Understanding system logs and key Linux directories
- CLI tools for auditing, monitoring, and securing systems

---

## ✍️ Reflections:

This was a hands-on refresher that tied real-world commands to actual security responsibilities.

- I previously used commands like `sudo`, but never fully grasped they granted **temporary root access** — a critical security concept.
- Concepts I’ve encountered before now have names, and processes I once ran without understanding now have context.
- I feel more confident handling Linux in a production/security environment going forward.

## ✅ What I Took Away:
- The CLI is more than just a tech flex — it's essential for analyzing, securing, and configuring systems quickly and efficiently.
- Linux knowledge is crucial for roles like SOC analyst, GRC auditing, and incident response.
